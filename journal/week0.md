## Homework Stretch Stretch Stuff I Did on My Own
- [x] Read chapter 1 of the official [AWS Solution Architect Study Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Study-Guide/dp/1119713080/ref=asc_df_1119713080/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459538011055&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1442647167613858578&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032112&hvtargid=pla-917135384856&psc=1) to cement my understanding of certain concepts. 
- [x] Ordered this book, [Building Secure and Reliable Systems: Best Practices for Designing, Implementing, and Maintaining Systems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492083127?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). I work as a customer-facing engineer and we've had some reliability issues lately, so I'm hoping to weave together learnings from this course and book.
